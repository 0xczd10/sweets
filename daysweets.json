        "description": "Hi there! Today, we’re going to make a delightful 'Berry Bliss Cake'. First, you’ll want to start by creaming together butter, sugar, and eggs until the mixture is smooth. Then, gently fold in the flour and baking powder, mixing just until combined. Now, it’s time to add the fresh berries – you can use strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries. Pour the batter into a greased baking pan and pop it into a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 45 minutes. While it bakes, the kitchen will smell wonderful! Once it’s done, let it cool for 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your beautiful berry creation!",

        "description": "We’re making a dreamy 'Frosted Strawberry Layer' cake today! Begin by preparing two sponge cakes. In a large bowl, beat together butter, sugar, and eggs until fluffy. Gradually add in flour and baking powder, alternating with milk. Divide the batter evenly between two pans and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 25 minutes. While the cakes are cooling, prepare a strawberry cream by whipping heavy cream, sugar, and finely chopped strawberries. Once the cakes have cooled, spread the strawberry cream between the layers and frost the entire cake with more cream. Decorate with fresh strawberries on top!",
